# TerraMon NG
This program allows you to enable monitor mode on chipsets that don't support airmon-ng in a (hopefully) airmon-ng-like way.

# Disclaimer:
I am not responsable for any damage caused by this program, use at own risk, even though it is probably safe.

The program is very new, many features need to be added yet.

Install instructions coming soon



Note: The "NG" is a (very bad) joke, and I am not affiliated in any way with the creators/contributers of the aircrack-ng suite.
